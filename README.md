# Paragraphs Type Clone

Paragraphs Type Clone allows users with the "Administer Paragraph types"
permission to clone paragraph types easily; saving the effort of adding fields
to a new type if the fields required are the same or almost the same.

The name, machine name, label, description and whether or not the paragraphs
can be unpublished from the admin interface are all configurable, whereas field
instances are copied exactly.

## Requirements
This module requires that the following module is also enabled:

- [Paragraphs](https://github.com/backdrop-contrib/paragraphs)

## Installation

## Configuration and Usage

screen when editing an exising paragraph type.
